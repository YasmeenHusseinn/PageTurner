# 📚 PageTurner

**PageTurner** is a modern React-based web application built as a personal bookshelf — inspired by my love of reading. This app lets users create, view, and edit digital “posts” that represent book recommendations. It’s a way for friends, fellow readers, and visitors to share and suggest books they think I should read! Built using Vite, Zustand for state management, and Axios for API communication, this project showcases key React patterns like routing, forms, and component-based architecture.
